### HOW TO START 
   - Starting a file in is simple, with a simple text editor is enough to write any program
   - After that we can run inside a terminal to execute


### HOW TO COMPILE
  - Using a compiler to decode our program and execute
  
  ```c
    //complie code
    gcc filename.c
    // Run Code
    ./a.out
  ```

### VARIABLES
 - String:
  ```c
    char grade = 'A'; //Important that we can only use only one charachter in this example
    char string[] = "Hello World"; // We create a string of character using actually an array
    

    calling a single string with use: %c
    calling a word use: %s


    Using string with printf:
    printf("Hello Sir, \"Whatever\" ") //rendering a cuotation mark using "\"
  ```

- Number:
 ```c
    int n = 42;
    int i = 40, 20, 30;
    double j = 3.6; // decimals

    calling a integer, %d "D" as decimal
    calling a double integer or decimal, %f "F" as float

    Using printf to returna integer:
    printf("%d", 500) //Using a format specifier to return a integer
    printf("My favorite %s is %d", "number", 500) 
    // My favorite number is 500

    

 ```
- Constants:
```c 
    Using constant are diferent from using a variable we cannot change it after we assign it.

    const int FAV_NUM = 5; //MAYUSC. as best practise, can be used with text as well
    printf("%d\n", FAV_NUM)

  ```



### TODO
* NEED TO LEARN WHAT IS MEMORY MANAGER INSIDE THE C

* WHAT I CAN DO AFTER I LEARN C
